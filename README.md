This is where I keep all diogo's config, secrets, and sanity. It's heavily inspired by [isabelroses/dotfiles](https://github.com/isabelroses/dotfiles) _(go follow her, she's a legend)_, but with diogo's own chaotic energy sprinkled on top.

## What's inside?

* **Nix flakes** for diogo's servers and machines (macOS + NixOS)
* **Home Manager** for all diogo's user-level stuff
* **Catppuccin** everywhere because pastel aesthetics > everything
* **Yabai** for tiling diogo's Mac
* **Neovim** set up with LSP, treesitter, and all the plugins I can't live without
* **Secrets** with SOPS and age _(shhh, don't peek)_
* **Justfile** for easy rebuilds and deployments
